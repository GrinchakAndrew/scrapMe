/*'width="device-width"' constrains the width of the layout to the device width. 
Surely setting 'intial-scale=1' is then telling the browser to zoom 100% (i.e. not scaled).
"target-densityDpi=device-dpi" tells to render the native device dpi scheme
"user-scalable=no" property prevents user from zooming in/out, guarantees that your images are exactly as you designed them.
