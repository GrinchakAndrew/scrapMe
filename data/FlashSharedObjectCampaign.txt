General info
To create simple flash redesign campaign one can use com.maxymiser.MmFlash object presented in Assets/AS3_Lib folder. 
Now we only have an opportunity to change design of static objects that are on the stage all over the time since flash object was loaded.
ActionScript version supported: 3.
We can run redesign tests to test Bitmaps, Shapes, SimpleButton objects, and other DisplayObjects that are not dynamically added to the Stage of the tested flash object.
 
All libs and source files can be found in the folowing folders:
\\192.168.166.3\Berestova Team\Vagin\flash\Assets\
\\192.168.166.3\Berestova Team\Vagin\flash\
You can try it by your own on example page:
http://devel.maxymiser.com/vagin/flash/index.html
Maxymiser domain name in AI:
domain.com
Maxymiser Campaign name in AI:
"FlashDemoCampaign"
 
Installation
 
To include Maxymiser Flash Campaign functionality in flash object to be tested, Maxymiser offers com.maxymiser package and Class com.maxymiser.MmFlash to use. 
All source JS and AS files are located in Assets/JS_assets and Assets/AS3_Lib folder.

To make some swf object response to maxymiser requests using com.maxymiser.MmFlash class one should perform the following:
 
Admin Interface side/JavaScript side:
 
Step1: Create campaign.
Step2: Create Script asset and map it to the test pages where the flash object is located.
Step3: Build Config object to be used by flash object to initialize campaign settings.
 
Use mmcore.FlashConfig(see Assets/JS_assets) function to register Elements for the campaign:
*/
 
mmcore.FlashConfig = {  
    registerCampaign: function (name, hide, actionSWF) {  
        var _t = this,  
            _cmp = _t[name] = {};  
        _cmp["hide"] = hide;  
        _cmp["maxyboxes"] = (actionSWF ? [actionSWF] : []);  
    },  
    registerVariant: function (name, swfUrl) {  
        var _t = this;  
        if (_t[name] && _t[name]["maxyboxes"]) {  
            _t[name]["maxyboxes"].push(swfUrl);  
        }  
    }  
}  
/*
mmcore.FlashConfig.registerCampaign - function to register Campaign:
parematers:
name - Name of the campaign
hide - how to hide the content of flash object.
0-Do not hide,
1-Hide whith method 1;
2,3,4 - Hide Methods are under develop.
actionSWF - URL of the flash object that contains Action Tracking Tools
 
mmcore.FlashConfig.registerCampaign("flashdemocampaign", 1, "http://devel.maxymiser.com/vagin/flash/actions.swf");  
 
Step4: Register all variants of the campaign using mmcore.FlashConfig.registerVariant function:
Function registerVariant allows you to register variant settings in "mmcore.FlashConfig" object mmcore.registerVariant(name, swfURL)
mmcore.FlashConfig.registerVariant - function to register Variant for campaign
parematers:
name - Name of the campaign
swfUrl - URL of the swf file that contains function to alter default swf object
*/


/* Definition url of swf file for variant*/  
mmcore.FlashConfig.registerVariant("flashdemocampaign", "http://devel.maxymiser.com/vagin/flash/restyle1.swf")  

/*HTML code:
Step1: Add “mxCampaign” variable to flashvars of the object is tested and set its value to the Campaign name:*/

<param name="flashvars" value="mxcampaign=flashdemocampaign" /  >  
 
/*This will tell “maxyflash” object, defined in flash object, that it must run “FlashDemoCampaign” campaign.
ActionScript side:
Step1: add “com.maxymiser” package to project library.
Step2: add following lines to ActionScript source code of flash object to create new MmFlash object(example: maxyflash) at any part of native code that will be run on load:
*/

import com.maxymiser.MmFlash;  
var maxyflash:MmFlash= new MmFlash(stage);  
 
/*
Step3: One should create flash objects and put them in the place, defined before by registerVariant javascript function, 
each file(exemple: "restyle.swf", "restyle2.swf", "restyle3.swf") 
must have “mmRedesign” function defined in their source code. 
mmRedesign function will be run when the object is loaded. 
It should contain instruction for the tested flash object what to change.
