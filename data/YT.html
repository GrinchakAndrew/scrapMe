                <h2 class="firstHeading">1.1. Management System in Maxymiser</h2>
                <div class="hr"></div>
                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">&gt; On a General Note:</h4>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Maxymiser management system is a mix-in between two Agile methodologies: Scrum and Kanban.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Agile Service Delivery rests on the following four pillars, part of Kanban methodology at Maxymiser:</p>
                <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">(2) Stand-ups: achieving the following –
                        <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Team Work;</li>
                                <li>Communication;</li>
                                <li>Mutual Trust;</li>
                                <li>Work Visibility.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>The basis of Kanban is a very simplistic idea: the amount of incomplete work should be held to its minimum towards maximum delivery of completed work. Finalized backlogged tasks will trigger new assignments. This is a ‘<strong>lean</strong>’ methodology: also known as a ‘<strong>pull</strong>’ management system.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Kanban (i.e., ‘<strong>token card</strong>’) serves as a visual aid to signal a possibility to "<strong>pull in</strong>" a new work. This signal stands for acceptance of new tasks.</p>
                            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Scrum, in Maxymiser:</h2>
                            <div class="hr"></div>
                            <h3>(A) One Team:</h3>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Maxymiser is subdivided into small, cross-functional, self-sustainable teams; however, the team is one, high-geared toward the common goal.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>The whole of the Team shares responsibility for campaigns and the related processes, undivided.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>The Team should be perceived as an unbreakable unit, closely knit together, conducive to a healthier work environment and greater productiveness.</p>
                            <h3>(B) Less Documentation:</h3>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Development life-cycle is guided by the Acceptance Criteria, represented by User Stories.</p>
                            <h3>(C) Sensible Time Planning:</h3>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Team’s timeline is divided into iterations for incremental delivery.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>The planned workload with the points per task can be re-prioritized in line with Agile continuous improvement and delivery.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Retrospectives are held at the end of each stage, seen to by the Scrum Master.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>‘<strong>Down time</strong>’ from campaign coding and QA is planned so that refinement sessions and updates allow for 6 hours per day solid work on a campaign.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>No fixed delivery dates: the dates for delivery may be flexibly adjustable, depending on the complexity of campaigns.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>For example, if it is very difficult to estimate the level of the campaign, or the amount of necessary time, and when estimations are provided for a complex campaign by a less experienced Developer.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Also, when there is a new Client and the nuanced website functionality is not fully known.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>If all of this is the case, a proximity range of dates should be scheduled, e.g.: worst-case scenario dates, best-case scenario dates and a working middle-ground timescale.</p>
                            <h3>(D) More Discussion – Fewer tools (aka, people drive tools not vice versa):</h3>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Team-wide priorities should be defined once a week at best.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Teams can communicate with the Client Services when there is a free time-slot.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Status reports are no longer necessary as Kanban board provides visual information about the workload.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">>Scrum methodology in Maxymiser rests on the following building blocks, which are part of the team-wide communicative loop:</p>
                            <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">(1) Refinement sessions: achieving the following –
                                    <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Collaboratively groom requirements of a campaign/project;</li>
                                            <li>Team planning and scoping of stories towards acceptance criteria: better understanding of objectives, resulting in improved quality and additional delivery options, e.g.: Technical Services team use their expertise to make suggestions;</li>
                                            <li>Shared ownership of delivery: improved cycle and iteration planning, improved communication and collaboration;</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Task-driven communication on the basis of Kanban board for better team-wide focus:</li>
                                            <li>Asking and answering the right questions, providing a clear summary about how the work is progressing, what information in addition may be valuable for the team (e.g. impediments);</li>
                                            <li>Cleaner backlog (i.e., <em>re-prioritisation, staying focused on the Kanban work tickets with only actual work items and tasks at hand</em>).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

						<h2 class="firstHeading">Kanban, in Maxymiser:</h2>
						<div class="hr"></div>
						<h3>Kanban, in Maxymiser:</h3>
						<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Kanban methodology in Maxymiser rests on the following building blocks:</div>
						<h4>(1) Visualization of work: achieved via Kanban board -</h4>
						<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">1.1. Use of online and offline Kanban boards:
							<div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Maxymiser employs Kanban to visualize the workflow via ‘sticky’ cards and a ‘Kanban’ board. The board is lined up into columns, each representing a stage of the ‘project’, i.e., a campaign. With the help of Kanban, Maxymiser increases cross-team communication and team play, improves quality with adaptive testing methodology (which integrates testing into development life-cycle, minimizes micro-management and Work In Progress).</div>
						</div>
						<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">1.2. Board Work Items allow a better status overview;</div>
						<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">1.3. Use of swimlanes to show workload per worker – allows swarming to help out;</div>						
<h4>(2) Limiting Work In Progress:</h4>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.1. Alignment and mapping of teamwork in progress against actual capacity.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.2. Planning flexibility towards faster work output.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.3. Focused Quality Assurance towards abolishing cross-checks; where appropriate, launching QA process during campaign coding phase.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.4. Avoiding situations when specific team members are overloaded; thus shorten their lead time, resulting in poorer quality (Little’s Law).</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.5. As an example, certain team members are assigned to specific Clients \ projects to accrue the lead time (productive time on the project).</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.6. Use of iterative approach: i.e., producing smaller deliverables; and\or delivering campaigns to Clients piece by piece.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">2.7. Attaining transparency throughout the development life-cycle: i.e., clarity in work, process policies, and business-based requirements.</div>
<h4>(3) Continuous Improvement: measuring effectiveness towards optimization, minimizing managerial effort, and analyzing workflow versus output.</h4>
<h4>(4) Client Involvement:</h4>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">4.1. Clients should be involved where possible;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">4.2. During refinement sessions clients could give their feedback straight away – less waiting time;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">4.3. Post-coding calls with clients help limit updates \ post-fixes;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">4.4. Scope and effect of changes more understandable for clients.</div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Kanban Roles in Maxymiser:</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h3>Kanban Roles in Maxymiser:</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Maxymiser Teams have the following roles:</div>
<h4>‘<strong>Scrum Master</strong>’: responsible for</h4>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">(1) helping everyone to overcome any hindrances during any performance stages,</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">(2) facilitating communications between the team members and the Client Services towards clarity in scheduling and operational resources management,</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">(3) CADs coordination and overall production process coordination.</div>
<h4>‘<strong>Business Analyst</strong>’: responsible for</h4>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Working as a part of the Client Services Team operates as a ‘<strong>Product Owner</strong>’.</div>
<h4>‘<strong>Maxymiser Sub-Team</strong>’: responsible for</h4>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Working with Kanban board. Team per task/campaign will subdivide into sub-teams (e.g. Dev(s)+QA(s)), while the Kanban board is common for everyone in the <strong>Team</strong>. <strong>Sub-teams</strong> take up the hands-on campaign development, monitoring, and implementation all of the applicable requirements in an effort to push the task through to delivery and into production as quickly as possible.</div>
<h4>‘<strong>Work Item</strong>’:</h4>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Timescale estimations are done by the <strong>sub-team</strong> during refinement sessions, according to the established Maxymiser workflow, known as a ‘<strong>work item</strong>’. Itemised workflow approach drives Kanban stand-ups meetings, helps to plan and visualize actual work tasks for the whole of the team.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  "><strong>Work items</strong> are the work tokens (i.e., cards) that make it possible for work to flow through the development process by its columnized representation on the board.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">A work item can be considered a sub-issue or an issue in the YouTrack. Work Items could be actual user-stories for a campaign or a campaign update request. Please note the statuses ‘<strong>QA Done</strong>’, ‘<strong>On Hold</strong>’, ‘<strong>Code Review</strong>’ are signifying these ‘<strong>work items</strong>’ in team-wide perspective:</div>

<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">The screenshot above shows a Scrumban board, lined up according to the 8 existing stages of an iteration (campaign):
    <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">
        <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">

Task status (cards) will also be evaluated every day during team stand-up.</div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Concept \ Story Creation:</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h3>Concept \ Story Creation</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">A story is a campaign-to-be that is usually handed down from CS Team: the concept of a campaign is ready, and should be further discussed and finalized from the perspective of the team. This stage involves stakeholder management and initial preparation of user acceptance criteria. Feasibility of stories is validated with local SE team.</div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Refinement Backlog:</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h3>Refinement Backlog</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">When the campaign is conceptually elaborated (user-stories are complete) it is backlogged for refinement: Customer Services Team has completed an iteration of user-stories or other technical updates.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">According to the current working backlog of the <strong>Team</strong>, the most optimal <strong>sub-team</strong> is singled out and assigned to the refinement backlog.</div>
<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Refinement:</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h3>Refinement</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Once determined capacity exists to refine a task it is assigned and put as a work in progress item to be consumed by the team. Task stays in refinement and will iterate across as many sessions (discussions) as the team needs to agree on defined user stories and acceptance. The discussion itself takes place across the whole of the sub-team: campaign development team (CS and TS) iterate through stories and requirements. Precise estimations are made for time-wise performance and campaign implementations. These estimations are used for planning of the tasks at hand. Changes in the estimations could be predicated on any subsequently emergent technicalities, risks, etc. Sometimes, estimations are negotiable, depending on the campaign-level or any contingencies. If other projects need refinement and have a higher priority, or the current task can’t be completed, it should go back into the <strong>refinement backlog</strong>. All scope calls, work with the Client, team reviews, work on CAD, documentation, happen here.</div>
<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Client Review (CAD):</h2>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h3>Client Review (CAD)</h3>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Any communications between CS and the Client technical representative to resolve some constraints that Maxymiser is unable to resolve. Once a definition of ‘done’ exists, and all the criteria are agreed and confirmed, the task may sit in <strong>Client Review</strong>. Depending on the team-wide decision, the team can immediately go into the backlog for “<strong>Pull</strong>”.</div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;"></h2>
<div class="hr"></div>
<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Backlog:</h2>
<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;  ">Tasks are being scheduled, according to the current workload of the Team. Usually, each participant of the refinement session (i.e., sub-team) is up for the task in view. Once a task is refined and signed off or ready to be taken up, it will sit in <strong>priority order in the backlog</strong>. Assigned development sub-team will pull tasks according to priority.</div>
